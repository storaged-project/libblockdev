 * @critical_warning: critical warnings for the state of the controller, see #BDNVMESmartCriticalWarning.
 * @avail_spare: Available Spare: a normalized percentage (0% to 100%) of the remaining spare capacity available.
 * @spare_thresh: Available Spare Threshold: a normalized percentage (0% to 100%) of the available spare threshold.
 * @percent_used: Percentage Used: a vendor specific estimate of the percentage drive life used based on the
 *                actual usage and the manufacturer's prediction. A value of 100 indicates that the estimated
 *                endurance has been consumed, but may not indicate an NVM subsystem failure.
 *                The value is allowed to exceed 100.
 * @total_data_read: An estimated calculation of total data read in bytes based on calculation of data
 *                   units read from the host. A value of 0 indicates that the number of Data Units Read
 *                   is not reported.
 * @total_data_written: An estimated calculation of total data written in bytes based on calculation
 *                      of data units written by the host. A value of 0 indicates that the number
 *                      of Data Units Written is not reported.
 * @ctrl_busy_time: Amount of time the controller is busy with I/O commands, reported in minutes.
 * @power_cycles: The number of power cycles.
 * @power_on_hours: The number of power-on hours, excluding a non-operational power state.
 * @unsafe_shutdowns: The number of unsafe shutdowns as a result of a Shutdown Notification not received prior to loss of power.
 * @media_errors: Media and Data Integrity Errors: the number of occurrences where the controller detected
 *                an unrecovered data integrity error (e.g. uncorrectable ECC, CRC checksum failure, or LBA tag mismatch).
 * @num_err_log_entries: Number of Error Information Log Entries: the number of Error Information log
 *                       entries over the life of the controller.
 * @temperature: Composite Temperature: temperature in Kelvins that represents the current composite
 *               temperature of the controller and associated namespaces or 0 when not applicable.
 * @temp_sensors: Temperature Sensor 1-8: array of the current temperature reported by temperature sensors
 *                1-8 in Kelvins or 0 when the particular sensor is not available.
 * @wctemp: Warning Composite Temperature Threshold (WCTEMP): indicates the minimum Composite Temperature (@temperature)
 *          value that indicates an overheating condition during which controller operation continues.
 *          A value of 0 indicates that no warning temperature threshold value is reported by the controller.
 * @cctemp: Critical Composite Temperature Threshold (CCTEMP): indicates the minimum Composite Temperature (@temperature)
 *          value that indicates a critical overheating condition (e.g., may prevent continued normal operation,
 *          possibility of data loss, automatic device shutdown, extreme performance throttling, or permanent damage).
 *          A value of 0 indicates that no critical temperature threshold value is reported by the controller.
 * @warning_temp_time: Warning Composite Temperature Time: the amount of time in minutes that the Composite Temperature (@temperature)
 *                     is greater than or equal to the Warning Composite Temperature Threshold (@wctemp) and less than the
 *                     Critical Composite Temperature Threshold (@cctemp).

 * - `"dhchap_key"`: NVMe In-band authentication secret in ASCII format as described

 * - `"reconnect_delay"`: The delay (in seconds) before reconnect is attempted after a connect loss.
 * - `"ctrl_loss_tmo"`: The controller loss timeout period (in seconds). A special value of `-1` will cause reconnecting forever.
 * - `"fast_io_fail_tmo"`: Fast I/O Fail timeout (in seconds).
 * - `"tos"`: Type of service.
 * - `"duplicate_connect"`: Allow duplicated connections between same transport host and subsystem port. Boolean value.
 * - `"disable_sqflow"`: Disables SQ flow control to omit head doorbell update for submission queues when sending nvme completions. Boolean value.
 * - `"hdr_digest"`: Generates/verifies header digest (TCP). Boolean value.

 * - `"tls"`: Enable TLS encryption (TCP). Boolean value.
 * - `"hostsymname"`: TP8010: NVMe host symbolic name.
 * - `"keyring"`: Keyring to store and lookup keys. String value.
 * - `"tls_key"`: TLS PSK for the connection. String value.
 *
 * Boolean values can be expressed by "0"/"1", "on"/"off" or "True"/"False" case-insensitive
